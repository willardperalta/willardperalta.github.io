## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Willard Peralta and I graduated from the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa in Spring 2020 with a Bachelor's of science in computer science. My general interests are currently in web and app development. To give some back story, I originally got interested in studying computer science because I was interested in digial media and film making. I was a videographer and video editor for a wedding cinematography company in Maui call Hifocused Cinematography where I used Canon DSLR cameras and edited videos in Adobe Premiere Pro. I also made some video projects on my own. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgoOUKRvinc&feature=emb_logo>"drone video I made in the summer of 2018!</a> 

## Web Development
My favorite part about digital media and videography was the sharing aspect of it, and how these digital projects eventually got published and shared online. This led to a curiosity of how the Internet itself even worked, and the rest is history. Now a graduate of computer science, I have learned the fundamentals of computer science, as well as learned how to use various basic technologies. In this portfolio I have some of my projects I made for classes, as well as some projects of my own. Feel free to check them all out!
