## Workout of the day(WOD)
The "workout of the day" is an essential practice that any aspiring software engineer must take part in. "Workouts of the day" or "WODs" are a way to get used to solving programming problems under stress. During a WOD, one would solve some kind of programming problem under a certain time limit. It's a good way to simulate a coding job interview. It's something I wish I knew about a long time ago because I feel like that's the one thing that has been missing from my education in ICS. A few months ago I went into a job interview for a part time student programming job. I went in not really expecting much, thinking that they were gonna just ask me a few general questions, and ask me what classes I've taken. But they took me by surprise when they took out a piece of paper and told me to complete a function. I luckily was able to talk my way through the solution, but I was so terrified that my palms were sweating the entire time. I didn't know how to act because I've never been exposed to a situation like that before. Thankfully because of WODs, I can have the exposure to solving problems under pressure. In general, I do not do very well under pressure so I'm glad that I get to practice this.

## Athletic Software Engineering
I never played sports in high school, but I was in marching band. Being in band I know that consistent practice is the best way to gain competency in any skill. In marching band we would perform what were called field shows, which involved a combination of playing our instruments, marching in step with each other, and performing complex choreography. At the end of our season we would participate in competitions against other schools on Oahu. In preparation for these competitions, consistent practice individually, and as a whole band was always stressed, as it was the only way to form the habits necessary to perform under stress. These marching band competitions were always stressful because not only were we competing against other bands, but we were also being watched by a fairly large croud of friends and family. The fact that it was also the last performance of the whole year also added on to the stress. This is why I'm all for athletic software engineering. It's a tactic that more software engineers should be aware of.
