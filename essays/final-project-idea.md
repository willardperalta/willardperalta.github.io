## Overview
	
 The Problem: Weather conditions across UH campuses are unpredictable, regular weather apps aren't good enough.

The Solution: Our app idea would be a weather app that would continuously update UH Campuses current weather. This would be helpful because of unpredictable weather. It would have ususal weather reports, plus info from people that are actually on campus. They can post pictures or share status updates in real time like twitter. 


## Approach

It could be an anonymous social network such as Yik Yak, or it could also implement accounts as well. There can be an icon for each campus where users could find information regarding weather conditions in that area. All info is user submitted and also has a rating system so users can downvote or upvote user submissions. 


## Case Ideas

User opens app and can check or post updates on weather conditions. 
User sets up account.
User takes pictures of conditions around campus, logs in and updates.
User upvotes or downvotes other posts with a button.

## Beyond Basics

Animation
Live chat/forum
