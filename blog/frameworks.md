## Framed!
I've been framed!...with using UI Frameworks. This past week I've been learning about UI Frameworks, specifically Semantic UI. Although definitely frustrating to learn, as with anything new in the programming world, I'm glad that it's in my life. Before taking my software engineering class, I always heard about "frameworks" but never understood what they really were. All I knew was that they were the things that were in style, and that everyone was using them. Knowing that I have this tool comforts me because I know that it's there to help me.

## Learning Curve
The first time I ever learned HTML and CSS was a few years ago on CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp, back when I was just trying to see what web design and programming was all about. At the time I had no prior experience with any type of programming. As I slowly and painfully typed out my desired margins and alignments, I thought to myself "Wow, there should really be a faster way to type all this out such that I can just say what I want, instead of painstakingly type out all of these little pixel perfect details". A few years later down the road in my computer science education I come across the wonderful Semantic UI. In Semantic UI, you pretty much can just say what you want in English like "large rounded image", instead of having to figure out what it takes for your image to be large. 

## Painting Your Masterpiece 
If I were to tell my naive younger self what a framework is, the closest thing I can think of is a template. At least that's the way that I think about it. Instead of having to type out the fact that you want to have margins on the sides of your page, you just put everything inside of a ui container and everything is automatically taken care of. When designing a web page, you don't want to be spending too much time focusing on things that can easily be taken care of and the things that don't really require much creative thought. You want to spend that time towards thinking about how your page will look. For example, if you want to learn how to paint beautiful water color paintings, you get better at it and create nicer designs by learning how to paint. What a surprise right? But imagine this. Imagine if while in the process of learning how to paint, you also had to learn how to gather supplies and equipment for your paintings. And I don't mean going to the store and buying a bunch of brushes, I mean imagine going out into nature and literally gathering everything from scratch to make all your paint mixes, brushes, and paper, rather than just going to Ben Franklin to get what you need. You'd spend half your time learning how to gather supplies, and the other half actually painting.

## Let the World See Your Masterpieces
I think UI Frameworks are the same thing. Using straight HTML and CSS to design websites is almost like going out into the wilderness and foraging for supplies to paint. Why would anyone do that? There are a lot more advanced, and precise painting tools that you can buy in Ben Franklin than you could probably make by yourself. If you can make painting supplies that are better than Ben Franklin's, then you might as well switch hobbies and create paint supplies rather than actually make the paintings. The point I'm trying to make is that it's in your best interest to use tools available to you especially if it helps facilitate your creativity. Frameworks allow you to spend more time on thinking about design rather than messing around with getting margins right. If you use frameworks then you are essentially getting quality supplies at Ben Franklin. When you're getting quality supplies at Ben Franklin, then you can create a lot of quality masterpieces for the world to see.
