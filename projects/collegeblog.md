summary: I took an English class in my last semester of college called "Digital Stories" and created a blog for the final project. The blog is about my 5 years in college.

## Blogging
I used this project as an opportunity to create a blog with just plain HTML and CSS and Visual Studio Code. I've never created a blog before so this was a great learning experience in content creation and creative writing. I originally didn't anticipate to be there so much content, so one thing I would have done different is to plan out my design more ahead of time. But regardless I had a lot of fun with this project.

## My College Story
I enjoyed this project because this will be something that I can look back on in the future to reminisce on what I did in college. The main events in my college career at UH MƒÅnoa include computer science, videography, and running!
