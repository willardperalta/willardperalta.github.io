## Web Development Self Study Projects
During my final semester at UH MƒÅnoa I decided to focus on web development. I revisited my old freeCodeCamp account and  started from the beginning where I went through lessons on HTML, CSS, and Javascript while learning different concepts related to responsive web design. Then I learned some front end libraries such as React and Bootstrap. I am currently doing the data visualization projects where I use D3.js to create some data visualizations. All of these small projects were made in Codepen.
