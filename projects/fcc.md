## Web Development Self Study Projects
During my final semester at UH MƒÅnoa I decided that I wanted to focus on web development. I wanted to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of web development since I didn't do much of it during college, so I revisited my old freeCodeCamp account and  started from the beginning where I went through lessons on HTML, CSS, and Javascript while learning different concepts related to responsive web design. Then I learned some front end libraries such as React and Bootstrap. I am currently doing the data visualization projects where I use D3.js to create some data visualizations, and then next I will learn backend technologies like Node.js. All of these small projects were made in Codepen.

## All of my Codepens
I created all my small projects in Codepen, if you're not familiar with Codepen, it's an interactive website where you can code small projects. These projects were made with the intention of practicing some skills I learned through freeCodeCamp. Here are all of them:
